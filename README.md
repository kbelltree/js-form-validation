This browser-based form was developed to demonstrate understanding of form validation using JavaScript. For more details on this project, please refer to the lesson ["Form Validation with JavaScript"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-form-validation-with-javascript) on The Odin Project.

## Key Project Instructions

- **Form Fields:** <br> The form should include the following input fields:

  - Email
  - Country
  - Zip Code
  - Password
  - Password Confirmation

- **Inline Validation:** Implement live inline validation and style the fields to indicate validation status.

- **JavaScript Validation:** Use JavaScript exclusively for validating all input fields.

- **Submit Action:** The submit button should demonstrate functionality but does not need to perform actual form submission.

- **Error Messages:** Display error messages upon submission if there are any empty fields or invalid entries.

- **Success Message:** Congratulate the user upon successful form validation.

## Built With

- **HTML** - Structure of the web form.
- **CSS** - Styling of the web form.

- **ESLint** - Linting JavaScript code to improve quality and consistency.
- **Prettier** - Code formatter to maintain consistent style.
